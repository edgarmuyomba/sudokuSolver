# Sudoku Solver

This is a react application used to solve the famous numbers game, [Sudoku](https://sudoku.com). Currently it only provides the ability to generate a random puzzle from an open source api, [Dosuku](https://sudoku-api.vercel.app/), solve the given board and visualize the working algorithm.

This project demonstrates my understanding of the working of simple algorithms and their use for complex use cases. In this case, the working of the backtracking algorithm and the use of matrices.

The live project can be found [here](https://sudoku-solver-eight-pi.vercel.app/).
